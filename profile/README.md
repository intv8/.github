## üí° Philosophy

[integer11][i11n] develops many things in [Deno][deno], and has developed many
utility libraries. partic11e is a rewriting of these libraries for public use
with an emphasis on simplicity and consistency across the public APIs.
Additional utility and feature libraries are being added to the partic11e
collection to make it easier to **build everything**.
